<p>Purpose</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I come from Biology and made my way toward imaging and image processing, entering the field of Bioinformatics a few years ago.
I started to use <strong>Python</strong> for this purpose and quickly grew fond of this wonderful language whose impact is hugely increasing in the scientific community.<br>
Being familiar with biostatistics and data analyses, I was curious of learning more general notions related to Data Sciences.
Doing so I discovered what brings me there, <strong>machine learning</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Machine learning is not that common, at least not yet, in fundamental research for Biology.
I found that a number of tools I already used for image processing (the Numpy/Scipy ecosytem) where actually behind some of the main Python libraries for Data Sciences, like Pandas and Scikit-learn.<br>
Nevertheless it was an entirely new field to me, and even if I already knew some tools I needed theory.
I started learning the basics of machine learning with MOOCs (especially the nice <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120">"intro to machine learning"</a> from Udacity), and experimenting using <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> in the meanwhile.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then I reached the part on <strong>Neural Networks</strong>&#8230;&#8203;<br>
I must say that right now I fascinated by these tools, and they are what triggered that blog.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My purpose here is to share what I learn and experiment, starting with Neural Networks, step by step.<br></p>
