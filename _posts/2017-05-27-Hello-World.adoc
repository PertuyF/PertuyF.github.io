First blog, first post

Purpose
--


I come from Biology and made my way toward imaging and image processing, entering the field of Bioinformatics a few years ago.
I started to use *Python* for this purpose and quickly grew fond of this wonderful language whose impact is hugely increasing in the scientific community. +
Being familiar with biostatistics and data analyses, I was curious of learning more general notions related to Data Sciences.
Doing so I discovered what brings me there, *machine learning*.

Machine learning is not that common, at least not yet, in fundamental research for Biology.
I found that a number of tools I already used for image processing (the Numpy/Scipy ecosytem) where actually behind some of the main Python libraries for Data Sciences, like Pandas and Scikit-learn. +
Nevertheless it was an entirely new field to me, and even if I already knew some tools I needed theory.
I started learning the basics of machine learning with MOOCs (especially the nice link:++https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120++["intro to machine learning"] from Udacity), and experimenting using link:https://www.kaggle.com/[Kaggle] in the meanwhile. +

Then I reached the part on *Neural Networks*... +
I must say that right now I fascinated by these tools, and they are what triggered that blog.

My purpose here is to share what I learn and experiment, starting with Neural Networks, step by step. +
